# CAP5610-HW1

This python program is used to calculate euclid distance, cosine similarity and correlation between two given vectors which are read from command inputs.

NumPy.py contains code using NumPy
SciPy.py contains code using pandas and SciPy functions

Example:
python3 ML.py
Enter first array (eg: 1 2 0):-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3
Enter second array (eg: 5 6 3):9 4 1 0 1 4 9
first vector: [-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3]
second vector: [9 4 1 0 1 4 9]
euclid distance: 14.966629547095765
Cosine Similarity: 0.0
correlation: [0]
